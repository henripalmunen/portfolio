This project was created as an extension to the analytics software QlikView for internal use within the Defence Forces. Its goal was to be able to quickly determine which machine learning model works best with a given task (i.e. with the data currently stored within the QV document). A lot of configuration work was done within QV which can't be shared for security reasons. Therefore, the code here isn't runnable as is.
